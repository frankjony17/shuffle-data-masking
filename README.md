# Shuffle Data Masking:
Shuffle masking masks the data in a column with data from the same column in another row of the table. Shuffle masking switches all the values for a column in a file or database table. You can restrict which values to shuffle based on a lookup condition or a constraint. Mask date, numeric, and string data types with shuffle masking.
